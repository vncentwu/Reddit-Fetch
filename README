QUESTION WRITEUPS:

1. setBitmap can possibly be called in URLFetch's ASyncTask in "doInBackground". 
On the other hand, getBitmap can be called in the main UI thread. 

If they are not synchronized, a get is called at the same time as a set and so the 
get will not properly return a bitmap, when they would have if it was sychronized. 
Since the cache won't be overwritten when using the same key, we are not concerned with
getting the wrong info, but simply not getting the info at all.

2. When we are in OnePost, it makes sense to put the full image at the front of the 
request queue because it is the only image currently visible to the user, and it is a 
high priority asset. The user experience won't be significantly negatively impacted
if a few thumbnails are missing, but a greatly delayed focal point will be much more noticable. 

The advantages of setting the flag to false means that it is more "fair", predictable, and easier to code.
On the other hand, the disadvantage of this is similar to what is mentioned above, in that
we do not discriminate between the importance of certain assets (main pictures vs thumbnails)

On the other hand, the advantage of setting the flag to true allows for a better user experience
due to faster load times on crucial elements. The disadvantage of this is somewhat greater
unpredictability, unfairness, and increase in code complexity.

3. I check to see if the term contains the character "&" as it basically allows for the term to end
and a modification to the actual url itself and not just the search term.
